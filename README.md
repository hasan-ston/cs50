# CS50 Problem Sets

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from [Harvard’s CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/).

## 📁 Structure

Each folder corresponds to a problem set from the course, organized by week and assignment:
- `pset1` – C basics, conditionals, and loops  
- `pset2` – Arrays, strings, and cryptography  
- `pset3` – Algorithms: searching and sorting  
- `pset4` – Memory, pointers, and images  
- `pset5` – Data structures (hash tables, linked lists)  
- `pset6` – Python  
- `pset7` – SQL and Flask

## 🧠 What I Learned

CS50 was my real introduction to computer science — not just syntax, but thinking like a computer scientist.  
From debugging segmentation faults in C to building web apps with Flask, every problem set forced me to slow down, reason through logic, and fail forward.  
It wasn’t always fun, but it was always worth it.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These solutions are here for personal archival and reflection.  
If you’re currently taking CS50, **don’t** copy or submit any of this code — it violates the course’s academic honesty policy.  
Use it to learn, not to cheat.
