- To characterize the audio aura of the listener whose top 100 songs from 2018 are contained in songs.db, we would
  calculate the average values of valence, energy, and danceability for these songs. For example, high energy indicates
  a more positive and dynamic vibe, while high valence suggests uplifting and cheerful music.

- This method considers the top 100 songs from only one year, which might not accurately represent the true nature of
  the listener's preference. Additionally, the top 100 songs might not capture the full diversity of the listener's music
  preferences, as they only reflect the most frequently played songs.

  from mulitple years would provide a more comprehensive view of the listener's evolving preferences and a more accurate
  represenation of their audio aura.
